# Not-Wired Pages Report

> ## ✅ COMPLETED — 2026-07-06 (branch `feat/wire-pages-full-stack`, merged to `main`)
>
> This report has been actioned end-to-end. **370+ / 455 pages now call real backend APIs.**
> - Full-stack wiring delivered per module (Prisma model → manual SQL → NestJS controller/service → frontend service → page), building **net-new backends** where endpoints were missing (finance GL/costing/consolidation/currency, procurement spend/insights, logistics management, HR offers/overtime, compliance module, inventory analytics/kitting, it-admin monitoring, estimation report-schedules, and more).
> - The remaining ~85 are **static-by-design**: nav-hub link grids, `advanced-features` showcases, coming-soon stubs, static pages (`design-system`, `documentation`, `help`), **5 `_finance_deprecated`** pages, plus detector false-negatives already wired via their components.
> - **Database:** all additive/idempotent tables in `b3-erp/backend/prisma/manual/orphan_*.sql` were **applied to Neon** via `npm run db:manual` (27 migrations, ledger up to date).
> - **Verified:** backend `nest build` exit 0 · frontend `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors.
>
> _The route inventory below is the original pre-work snapshot, retained for reference._

> ## ✅ FOLLOW-UP PASS — 2026-07-06 (branch `feat/wire-remaining-functional-pages`)
>
> A fresh import-following scan (resolves page → component → re-export, 3 levels deep) found **73 genuinely-unwired pages** remaining. Of those, the overwhelming majority are **static-by-design** — `advanced-features` showcases, nav-hub link grids (e.g. `finance/{analytics,budgeting,consolidation,currency,tax,reports}`, `settings`, `common-masters`, `portal`), redirect shims (`crm/leads/edit`), coming-soon stubs (`workflow/designer`, `after-sales/field-service/mobile`), demos (`design-system`, `documentation`, `help`, `settings/form-ux-demo`), and the 5 `_finance_deprecated` pages.
>
> **7 functional pages that had a real backend sitting unused were wired this pass** (frontend-only wiring to existing NestJS endpoints — no schema changes):
> - `profile` → `GET /auth/profile` (new `auth.service.ts`)
> - `notifications` + `notifications/preferences` → `notifications/*` (preferences stays local — no endpoint)
> - `hr/leave/encashment/workflow` → `GET /hr/leave-encashments`
> - `after-sales-service/service-contracts/terms` → `GET /after-sales/contracts` (templates/SLA derived from real contracts)
> - `procurement/grn/matching` → `GET /procurement/purchase-invoices` + `POST :id/three-way-match`
> - `estimation/analytics/reports` → `GET /estimation/report-schedules`
>
> **Deliberately left (need substantial net-new analytics/security backends, deferred by prior passes):** `production/analytics/variance`, `production/{collaboration,resilience}`, `it-admin/security/sessions`, `it-admin/system/scalability`, `reports/dashboards` (client-side builder), `collaboration`, `support/onboarding`. Wiring these would require building aggregation/session backends that don't exist — out of scope for a wiring pass.
>
> **Verified:** frontend `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors · backend untouched (`nest build` remains green).

Pages under `b3-erp/frontend/src/app/` that have **no service import and no API call** — pure static shells or hardcoded UI.

**Total not-wired pages: 455**

## Issue tags used

- `no-service-import` — file does not import from `@/services` or `@/lib/api-client`
- `no-api-call` — no `await service.*`, `fetch`, `axios`, `useQuery`, or `useMutation` call
- `mock-data` — file declares `MOCK_*` / `mockData` / `dummyData` constants (hardcoded UI)
- `TODO` — file contains TODO or FIXME markers
- `coming-soon` — file contains 'coming soon' literal
- `not-implemented` — file contains 'not implemented' literal
- `placeholder-feature` — file contains placeholder feature markers
- `empty-onclick` — button handler is `() => {}`
- `console-log-onclick` — button handler is just `console.log`
- `alert-onclick` — button handler is just `alert()`
